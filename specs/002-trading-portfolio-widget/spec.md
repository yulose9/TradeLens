# Feature Specification: Trading Portfolio Widget

**Feature Branch**: `002-trading-portfolio-widget`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Build an Android widget-focused application that surfaces the user's Trading 212 portfolio information via the Context7 wrapper for Trading 212's API Beta. The app's primary function is to display the user's total portfolio value, current profit/loss (absolute and percentage), and a small list of open positions with per-position profit/loss and quantity. Widgets must support multiple sizes and versions (compact 1x1, standard 2x2, wide 4x1, and an expanded 4x2 with sparkline). Widgets should refresh frequently enough to feel "almost real-time" but respect API rate limits and device battery (configurable refresh: e.g., fast (1–2 min), normal (5–15 min), and battery-saver (30+ min)). The system should cache the last known good snapshot so the widget can display immediately on load without waiting for a network. Provide a minimal settings UI to add/refresh API credentials, configure refresh frequency, and select which accounts/positions to show. The app should handle offline gracefully (show cached values with a “stale” indicator), surface errors clearly (invalid token, network errors, rate-limited), and allow manual refresh via the widget. Multiple widget versions should be feature-gated (v1: balance + P/L; v2: add positions + small sparkline; v3: add notifications and thresholds). The WHY: so the user can glance at their portfolio value and recent movement without opening the full Trading 212 app; the widget should be fast, private, battery-friendly, and customizable.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - View Portfolio Value (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see my total Trading 212 portfolio value and current profit/loss (absolute and percentage) directly on my home screen widget, so I can quickly assess my financial position without opening the full app.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition and the most frequent user need.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a widget and verifying that the displayed value and P/L match the latest API snapshot or cached data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid API credentials, **When** the widget loads, **Then** it displays the latest portfolio value and P/L.
2. **Given** no network, **When** the widget loads, **Then** it displays cached values with a "stale" indicator.

---

### User Story 2 - View Open Positions (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see a list of my open positions with per-position profit/loss and quantity, so I can track individual holdings at a glance.

**Why this priority**: Enables deeper insight into portfolio composition and performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting positions in settings and verifying correct display in the widget.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** selected positions, **When** the widget loads, **Then** it displays each position's symbol, quantity, and P/L.
2. **Given** an invalid token, **When** the widget loads, **Then** it displays a clear error message.

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Widget & Refresh (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to configure refresh frequency, select accounts/positions, and manually refresh the widget, so I can balance data freshness, battery usage, and customize my view.

**Why this priority**: Empowers users to tailor the experience to their needs and device constraints.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by changing settings and observing widget behavior and refresh intervals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a selected refresh frequency, **When** the widget is added, **Then** it refreshes at the configured interval.
2. **Given** manual refresh action, **When** pressed, **Then** the widget updates immediately (subject to rate limits).

---

### User Story 4 - Widget Version Feature-Gating (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want to access new widget features (positions, sparkline, notifications) as they are released, so I can benefit from improvements without breaking existing functionality.

**Why this priority**: Ensures backward compatibility and staged rollout of advanced features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling/disabling features and verifying widget content changes accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** v1 widget, **When** added, **Then** it shows balance and P/L only.
2. **Given** v2 widget, **When** added, **Then** it shows positions and sparkline.
3. **Given** v3 widget, **When** added, **Then** it shows notifications and thresholds.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when API rate limit is exceeded? (Show error, delay refresh, inform user)
- How does system handle invalid/expired API credentials? (Show error, prompt for re-auth)
- What if no positions are open? (Show empty state message)
- What if device is offline for extended period? (Show cached data, "stale" indicator)
- What if user disables battery optimizations? (Warn about potential battery impact)
